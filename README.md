# Java Project with Gson

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Strategy Pattern in Java, using the Gson library for JSON serialization and deserialization. It includes examples of converting objects to JSON and CSV formats.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Java JDK 11 or later
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Java IDE)
- Maven (usually bundled with IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/singhsanket143/StrategyPatternProject/tree/main
   cd StrategyPatternProject
   ```

2. **Open the Project**

   Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred IDE.

3. **Build the Project**

   Your IDE should handle the dependencies automatically. If not, you can build the project manually using Maven:

   
   mvn clean install
  

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the `src/main/java` directory, find the main class (e.g., `StrategyPatternDemo.java`), and run it through your IDE.
